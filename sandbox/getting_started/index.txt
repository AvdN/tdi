=================
 Getting Started
=================

In order to use the TDI you need two components: a template (usually a
file containing the markup) and a piece of python code which models the
result based on the template.

.. _the_template:

This chapter shows you step by step how to use TDI in general. For this
purpose there's an HTML file I'm going to refer to from time to time.
It's located in the source distribution and named
``docs/examples/getting_started/basic.html``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/getting_started/basic.html
    :language: html

It might look pretty silly, but it contains typical use cases, we're
going to cover. The first -- obvious one -- is that the file does not
contain HTML alone. Certain elements contain attributes named ``tdi``.
These attributes name the elements (or nodes of the markup tree) which
are possibly manipulated by the template code later. And that's most of
TDI you're going to see within the templates themselves.

The following subsections explain the main concepts of TDI:
